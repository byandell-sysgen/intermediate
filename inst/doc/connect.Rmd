This is an example of installing a package from github via Rstudio Connect.
This code is in `inst/doc` folder of the `byandell/intermediate` package, and installs the intermediate package. See [RStudio Connect Git-Backed Content](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/)

Larger goal is to run a shiny app in package `byandell/qtl2shiny`, which depends on this package and on `byandell/qtl2mediate`, as well as other packages on CRAN.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("byandell/intermediate")
```

```{r}
library(intermediate)
```

```{r}
example(mediation_scan)
```
